            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

So, me thinks I see his compassionate eye, looking upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed face; fire from heaven falling upon this acceptable sacrifice; tears quenching all Indignation, reformation (as <hi>Rahahs</hi> thread hung out of the window) keeping the house in safety; judgment drawing back; the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying Angel called off; the arrows taken off the string; the viol of wrath set by: So

That religion should be made the object of their rallery, who make it not their care and business to search into it, yet throw out their bitter scoffs and profane jests against it, doth not become the gravity of a nation professing wisdom to permit, much less the sobriety of a people professing Christianity. Those whose first approaches to goodness were mercinary and out of compliance to others, may, by coming within view of it, discern it so Amiable, that they may after love it for it self.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:200424:85"/> Earth. But what tearms of wonder or grief can be sufficient enough to express or bewail so strange, and perverse degeneration; that <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> should be as much <hi>Heathen</hi> as <hi>America;</hi> that the Light of the world should thus darken it; the salt of the Earth be the means of putrifying and corrupting it; that those who were by God drawn out from the heathen world, should so outvie the Gentiles crimes, as if they had forsaken them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because they were too innocent. So universall a depravation is there among us, that we have scarce any thing left to distinguish us from the <hi>most barbarous people,</hi> but our <hi>better name</hi> and <hi>worser vices.</hi> We ridiculously contend for the title of the best Christians, but such acts deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate us none at all; and make that sacred name serve only to upbraid the contrariety of our practice. That which was once the index to point out all morall and divine virtues, now marks out that part of the world where least of them reside. Yet, while we damn heathens for their morall virtues, we are so stupid, as to hope our selves to be saved by their worst vices. True practick virtue, which once made such victorious salleys on the heathen world, is now baffled in its own quarters, beaten from its works, and driven to seek shelter in obscure corners; immures it self in some private breasts, and like an exil'd Prince, makes only shift to live, when it should reign. 'Tis one of Satan's subtillest stratagems, to fill Christ's camp thus, with his souldiers; by whose intestine treachery, he hath been more triumphant than by all his open as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:200424:86"/> and arrow'd Hostilities. 'Tis too evident how much Christianity loses, by the miscarriages and contests of its <hi>professors,</hi> which while they pretend to guard, do indeed invade her under her own colours. <hi>Christian religion</hi> hath allways had the hap to suffer, what was once the fate of the great <hi>Authour of it,</hi> crucifixion between two thieves: <hi>Irreligion</hi> on one hand, &amp; <hi>contention</hi> on the other; &amp; while they two have been spitting their venome in her face, her professors have been behind her with thornes, and nailes, and spears; and the injury she hath received from <hi>her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemies,</hi> have been far exceeded by those of <hi>her own house.</hi> As long as the <hi>lives of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> where the transcripts of their doctrin, they rendered it venerable to all; and gave a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was some thing more than humane in it, that could work such signall effects, and so transform men, as to make the adulterer chast, the drunkard temperate, the covetous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, the contentious peaceable. So long as Christianity waged war only with forraign enemies, she never missed to be victorious; for while she was <hi>persecuted,</hi> she was <hi>victorious;</hi> they were enamoured on her when besmeared with bloud, courted her in the flames, bow'd to her on the Gibbit. It hath always been invulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against all darts, but what have been taken out of her own quiver, and could never have sunk to such a despicableness by any endeavours, but our own: of which the primitive times were pregnant testimonies: where all the most weighty cruelties, and bloudy persecution
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:200424:86"/> never made any breach in her, but she stood firm for all those batteries; and like an arch'd building, became more strong and compact by all that weight that was design'd to crush her. But, the <hi>vices of professors</hi> undermine her very foundation; and as much exceed the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveness of the most hostile assaults; as intestine treachery is more ruinous and fatall, than forraign violence. This sacred gourd, throve and flourished so long as watered with its mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs bloud; in absence of which, the Devill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd those two wormes, contention and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaness, that hath smote the root of it, and made its branches to fade and wither. The persecution of Christians being ended, the martyrdome of Christianity began when, they had done suffering for the faith, the faith began to suffer by them: and it hath lost much of its fame and repute in the world, ever since its face hath been soiled with the debauchery, and its garments torn with the divisions of its profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, expos'd to ruine and contempt. Ah me; what a slaughter of soules hath been in this Age? Whilst the wandring and only flock of Christ is divided into parties, the devouring wolfe lyes ready to destroy the scattered fold: this runs away, because the pipe playes an accustomed tune, because it must feed with a bended knee, because the shepherd wears a linnen garment, &amp; differs the innocent fleeces with a scandalous brand; and that brings his Lambs to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and they wantonly wash (drown) themselves: one prefers this, another that, a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:200424:87"/> third neither, and the greater part none at all; but had rather have a freedome in the field, rages against folds, and leapes over them; untill driven about with errors, drops into the <hi>Roman</hi> fold; so, what he foolishly feared, is hurried head-long into, by seeking to avoid. The wild-fire of passion, hath nigh consumed brotherly love; that fire is almost out, and scarce a spark of it appeares. Many live as if they had been born on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of <hi>Bether</hi> and baptis'd in the water of <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah.</hi> Were mens reprobates, Gods reprobates, all the world would be damned. So, while he that is without heares each <hi>Sect</hi> thunder out damnation against each other, he cannot but be startled at the danger of adhering to the wrong; and though that may a while excite his diligence, to discover the right; yet when he comes to that inquisition, he meets with so many pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick intricacies to intangle him, that after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny turnes from one side to another, hee'l be apt to think, the onely clew to extricate himself out of this Labyrinth of many religions, is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon all. Nor can any take a more malicious and effectuall course to disgrace, reproach, and do Christianity the greatest dispite and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief than <hi>to profess it, and live contrary:</hi> It more discourages others from embracing than the highest charecter we can give of, can perswade them to it: And while we would gain them to become Christians, by telling them of our holy precepts and hopes, of an undefiled state, what a Holy God we serve, what a perfect pattern we imitate, what
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:200424:87"/> a holy spirit guides, directs, strengthens, assists us. Their wicked lives who professe themselves Christians (and so to have supernaturall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to be Sanctified, washed, regenerate, born of God,) loudly proclaim; that either 'tis our religion to sin, or that Christianity is a barren, unfruitfull, weak, powerlesse, ineffectuall thing, or we our selves secretly believe it to be a ly, that without holinesse we may see God; and Heaven, if there be any such place, is an inheritance among the unsanctified; that God is pleased with any thing, and glad of any company; so we cannot reasonably expect they should believe us, when they see we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe our selves.

I tremble to think, God grant this day of blasphemy, be not laid to our charge. That which was designed to perfect and fill up the law, hath by the strange pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie of those that live as if they profest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,

Feigned piety is the mother of prophanesse, and atheism; hence religion it self comes to be questioned and what is true, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be so. And because the outward Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit displeases some, the very face of religion begins to be detested, flouted at, and put to an undeserved blush; and fears the whole world will be censured for hypocrisie; so hugs it self in its retired life and hermitage. The <hi>wits</hi> of our age give many a gird, fling many squib at it, for the disorderly actions of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; they have procured Christ many a taunt, and flout, put many a <hi>mock-robe</hi> upon him, many a Reed and Scepter into his hand, set many a Crown of thorns upon his head, calling him Lord, but revile and spit upon him. Thus is Christ wounded in the house of his friends, and hath more reproaches cast on him by those that professe his name, than by the loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est blasphemies of those that oppose it.

He appears in defence of Gods word and ways, with more courage, resolution, and boldnesse, than others in opposing or pleading against them. 'Tis the wisest, safest course to take the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est side; greater is he that is with us, than they that are with them: When Gods cause and glory suffers, he that is not for God is against him, and he that gathers not with him, scatters abroad; so, by fearing a lesser danger, falls into a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; to save his cloaths, breaks his neck. He is not ashamed of his profession, and dare be religious when it exposes to danger, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is so hard and chargeable to keep as a good conscience; and he that departs from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, makes himself a prey, and is accounted mad for his pains.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:200424:98"/> to see the evident proofs of his Masters favour. Let <hi>Michal</hi> revile his dancing before the <hi>Ark,</hi> his patience stops all mouths and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases Crowns.

Shamefac'tness is for them, in whose coat of arms they may well put in the <hi>Devils cloven-foot;</hi> virtue is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand escutcheons. He abhors the basenesse of being bafled out of a truth or virtue: A good cause divests sufferings (in what dresse soever they appear) of their dreadfull shape; pulls off the ugly vizard; and shews us a beauty that lay there concealed; wise men may be argued out of a religion they own, none but fools and mad men will be drol'd out of it; sooner laugh'd out of their estate, than out of their hopes of eternall happinesse. He prizes his Masters honour more than his own interest: having fixed his end, he takes his way as he finds it; all weather is fair to a willing mind. 'Tis indifferent to him whether he be consumed by Martyrdom, or religious employment, or what manner of death he shall die: If he prize any thing in the world, as his own, 'tis that he hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to esteem as nothing for Christ. Desire of gain or glory, fear of disgrace or danger, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces not him to pernicious practices; a man can never be undone by the greatest losse he can sustain, for preserving an interest in Gods love and favour. He is rich and happy, whose por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is God, and inheritance Heaven, how
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:200424:99"/> great soever his sufferings and losses, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with their greatest worldly gain or glory are poor and miserable. And yet, here, where the prize is so rich, the tearms so easie, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest so certain, the detriment of refusing it so inestimable, how many insignificant combatants are there in the Christian camp that only lend their name to fill up the <hi>muster-roule,</hi> but never dream of going upon service? If we fight not manfully under our Saviours banner against sin, the world, and the Devill, 'tis not materiall what profession we make; we are the same desertors whether we stay in our own camp, or run over to the enemies, throw away our arms, or not use them, renounce our Christian faith, or not improve it. Sloath is as mischievous in war as treachery or cowardise And, he that keeps his sword in the sheath, is as formidable an enemy, as he that brings none into the field. Christianity is our badge or cognizance of the cause and generall we fight for; to engage us to all the obedience, fidelity and constancy of Resolute souldiers. They that please not themselves with the empty title, but penetrate the full purport and significancie of their Christianity, will find themselves assaulted by such force of reason, that they must be either very ill Logicians, or very good Christians: &amp;, they that look on the eternall things <hi>that are not seen,</hi> will through those opticks exactly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the vanity and inconsiderableness of all that is <hi>visible,</hi> and temporary; and so (while others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily desert that cause they find chargeable to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:200424:99"/> maintain, and chuse the way of the wicked, whose prosperity they envy) will be equally unmoved with the terrors or allurements of the world, and neither frighted nor flattered off their duty. He would not be saved alone, but is still provoking and winning over others to a love of the truth. When 'tis customary to speak more of persons, than things; and reckoned a peice of ingenuity to raise or improve a story, to wound the fame of an enemy, or play with the reputation of a friend: when blasphemous hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites words are stout against God, then they that feared the Lord spake oftenone to another <note n="(i)" place="margin">Mal. 3. 16</note> by way of counsell &amp; encouragment in the wayes of God; that the sincerity and eminency of their piety, may be sufficient to overwhelm the contrary perversness. He hath as many chaines to oblige men to his maker, as he hath given him means of well doing. He perfumes every place with his presence, and 'tis hard for any to come from him, no whitt holyer than he went. While others are drawing in partners of their Damnation, he is pulling them out of the fire: even permission in those things we might reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, makes us no less actors than consent; some kill as much by looking on, as others by smiting: whosoever gives the blow, the murder may be ours: 'tis all one, to hold the sack, and to fill it: we are guilty of all the evill we might have hindered. Foolish Christians, in stead of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the truth, think it forsooth, discretion and moderation, with a complying silence, and perhaps a smile to boot, tacitly to approve and strike in with the scoffer, and so go sharer both

He becomes a <hi>Saviour</hi> without a cross; and payes but a little breath for that, which exhausted the bloud of his <hi>own.</hi> He that by a strict and exemplary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation sets himself up a Land-mark, to direct men in this turbulent, and dangerous sea, though his light goes forth to others, the warmth and cherishing heat of it remaines in his own breast.

If the foot be pinched, the back bends, the head bowes down, the eye looks, the hand stirs, the tongue calls for aid, the whole man is in pain, &amp; labours for redress: being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the same body, we pray for our selves in praying for others: Then may we <hi>rest satisfied,</hi> when conscience tells us we have neglected no meanes for redressing our miseries; but may look for <hi>amendment</hi> or <hi>patience</hi> by the personal perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our duty: we shall procure to our selves at least the great benefit that would accrue to the nation, by a Generall reformation: either the affliction shall be kept or taken off thee, or laid on in so much mercy, that thy self shall bless God for it; whereas the contrary may cost thy tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall or eternal ruine.

Instead of just petitions, we insert our own distempered passions.

With the noise of our imaginary crimes, we stop that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:200424:118"/> of our personal, detestable, execrable sins. We endeavour to fetch over Heaven with a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. We cry cunningly, artificially, by parts, and halves, but we can't speak out our proper sins, nor lance the wound to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, when we are begging balsome from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. We are the greatest impostures in our devotions: There is a craft in our prayers; we dissemble in our petitions, as well as in our practices, and in our prayers have the art of conveyance to slip in other mens sins, rather than our own. We make our selves so much work about others faith, that we are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at leisure to regulate our own practice; and so have no way of stating our accounts with God, but by ballancing the excess of the one, against the defects of the other. 'Tis not seeing men have no religion, but one different from our own, that awakes our indignation. How many who are at odds upon a religious, can unite upon a vitious account; That mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually denounce damnation to each other, with full accord combine in those practices which ascertain it to them both; as if they so much feared to have their prediction, that they would be each others, convoy to the land of darkness. Those that will not by no means meet at the Church, know not when to part at the Tavern; that will not jointly partake of the cup of the Lord, are yet very sociable at the cup of Devils and excessive debauches, which are a most accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able drink-offering to the infernal spirits.

We measure our religion, not so much by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position it makes to our lusts, as to those whom we first make, and then call our enemies. We make it a part of our religion, to tear and mangle Christ's body, when heathen souldiers that crucifi'd him, thought his coat too good to be parted. O how can we expect our sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices should be accepted, till salted with love? and know no difference between party and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but owne all as fellow-members, that are partakers of the influence of the head.

'Tis the glory of a man to pass by an offence, much more thine, whose prerogative principally it concerns <note n="(x)" place="margin">Ex. 34. 67.</note>, and art unbounded in acts of grace. Lord glorifie thy <hi>Prerogative;</hi> shew thy self to be <hi>God,</hi> by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving our great offences, and to be above Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and Subject, by forgiving both. Let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that thou art <hi>God,</hi> and there is none like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, by pardoning those sins and remitting those punishments, that none else can. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphed in misery, because we are deluged in sin; all our misfortunes proceed from misdemeaners; take away our guilt, and our griefes will follow: let <hi>England</hi> be pardoned, and then we doubt not
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:200424:165"/> but it will be preserved. And do not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, but reform us; let all that have received power, &amp; authority from thee, improve it for his interest to whom all power in Heaven and earth is given. Awaken our Magistrates to greater vigilancy in searching out, suppressing, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impiety: against licentiousness of Judgment and practice; let <hi>holiness</hi> have, not only a <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> but an <hi>authority</hi> among us, make our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers peace, and our Exactors righteousness, that we may be an eternal excellency, and the joy of many generations <note n="(y)" place="margin">Is. 60. 15.</note>. Let us search and try our waies, and turn unto thee our God; as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally and industriously combine to propitiate, as we have to provoke thee. Make us a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people zealous of good works. Let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the just. Give thy people one heart and one way. Let every one that names the name of the Lord live as becomes the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, depart from all iniquity; weep day and night, and give thee no rest untill thou have mercy on us. Thou that turnest the rock into a standing water and the flint into a fountain of water <note n="(z)" place="margin">Ps. 114. 8.</note>, strike upon <hi>these</hi> that are before thee. O <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>mercies,</hi> pity us who know not how to pity our selves. Though we have cast of all <hi>bowels,</hi> let us find <hi>them</hi> all concentred in thy self; heal our <hi>wounds,</hi> and which of all others is the most desperate, our <hi>unwillingness to be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> let the spirit of peace overshadow us; and impress on us the dove-like qualities of meekness and gentleness. Rescue our religion from our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation;
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:200424:165"/> not by taking it from us, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us to it. Do for us not only above what we can ask or think, but beyond what we would wish or chuse; and suffer us not to acquire the miseries we so eagerly pursue. Let us be happy in that relation, of having the Lord for our God: save thy people, bless thine inheritance; feed them also, and list them up for ever <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ps. 28. 9.</note>. O canst thou see thy <hi>Sion</hi> a shipwracking, and not lend thy hand? Can the Shepherd be content to see the wolves worry his tender flock? The Father love to behold his children hate one another? Dearest Lord is not thy <hi>glory</hi> dearer to thee, than to thy spouse? Shall she be solicitous, and wilt not thou seem so to provide against thy disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Is the Crown of Christ glistering enough on his head in the eyes of all the world? Hath our Jesus the full procurement of his blood? Hast thou left thy compassions, as well as the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thy body behind thee on earth? Is <hi>our Joseph</hi> in Heaven where there is provision e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and shall thy brethren starve for want of crumbs of comfort from thy table? Are thine affections altered with thy condition? Dost thou in thy glory trample under foot thy children, whom thou accounted as the apple of thine eye in the daies of thy sufferings? Shall we give over praying for opening the blind eye, and softening the hard heart? Shall we fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep and urge thee no more? Shall we pull our hands from thy plough, and our necks from thy yoke? Will the Lord dispense with our luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnese, and wink at our apostacy? Is it not
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:200424:166"/> thy burthen to see thy spirit so grieved? To see such noisome weeds and errors to grow in thy garden, which thou so much regardest? And so much backsliding after so much profession of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? Hath not the Lord said <hi>his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> shall be established in the top of <hi>all the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Is. 2. 2. Mich. 4. 1.</note>? And that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall be made the joy of many generations? Is not this thy own hand and seal? How long stay thy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot wheels? Is the Lord angry at the prayers of his people, and not at the blasphemies of his enemies? Art thou offended because we <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>Sion,</hi> and wilt thou not if we forbear? Have we already the first fruits and shall we never have the harvest? Will the Lord comfort us mourning, enliven us dying, or raise us when bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and in our graves? O Lord, though thou dishonourest thy people, yet wilt thou disgrace the Throne of thy glory? Will not the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary say, surely if God in love had thus begun to build, he would have gone on to finish? Though we are trampled under foot, must thy Christ also? If his body hath deserved to sit on dunghills, &amp; lie in fetters of Iron, our head hath merited to sit on a Throne, &amp; to have the liberty of his spirit in the world. Though our prayers are rejected, yet wilt thou not fulfil thine own promise? Thou hast a Prerogative to save and destroy, but art thou not bound in Covenant to set up thy Son? And if thou make not hast for his glory, will not the world be ready to say the Lord is gone back of his word? Is it only free grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and not also justice and righteousness for our

Or hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to see if we will earnestly seek after him? Because his smiles have not caused us to love him, will he now frown on us, to make us to fear him? Are the golden daies of his spiritual presence gone, and not to come, as we hoped they were? That we should rather put mourning on our backs, than take harps in our hands? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause England hath been perfidious and perjuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God, will God now break his covenant of faithfulness with England? Shall the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness of man, make God unfaithful? Did the Lord of old wait to be gracious, and will he now wait till we are gracious? Was the Lord wont to be found of those that sought him not, and will he not be now found of those that seek him? Wilt thou not pardon our hypocrisie, pride, passions, and prophaness till we <hi>repent,</hi> and is not <hi>that,</hi> thy gift? Shall disconsolate <hi>Sion</hi> never be ransomed from her spiritual sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and distractions, till worthy? Is not the price of her redemption already paid? and will the Lord seem to require the debt again? Lord, are we so far gone from thine house, like prodigals, that either we want an heart to return or an hope, if we return, that our father will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of us? Art not thou the God of peace? Is not thy son, the son of peace? Thy spirit, the spirit of peace? Thy Gospel, the gospel of peace? And shall not thy children, be children of peace?
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:200424:167"/> Is Christ in one of his followers, against Christ in another? Is Christ divided? Blessed <hi>father,</hi> how shall the world know we are <hi>thy children,</hi> if we have not thy <hi>Image?</hi> Thy <hi>servants,</hi> if we wear not thy Livery? Will the world be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by our <hi>divisions,</hi> that <hi>thou</hi> art <hi>love?</hi> Thy people see not so much prophaness in the world, as the world sees passions among thy people. We censure and condemn them for not agreeing with thy people, whilest they see thy people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not amongst themselves. Ah Lord! if <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> be the onely badge of <hi>thy disciples,</hi> how few hast thou in the world? Is this a time to pull down, and not at all to build up? To cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way stones and to divide, and not to gather stones to raise thy temple? Art thou resolv'd no more stories shall be built in <hi>Sion,</hi> till one stone be not left on another in <hi>Babylon?</hi> Are the grounds of our feares, not only from thy secret or open enemies, but also from the vain conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of the professours of thy name?

How have we been tithing mint, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise, &amp; cummin, neglecting the salvation of soules, &amp; weighty matters of the Lord? O, when will the candle of the Almighty, shine on the heads of thy people as of old? When shall the name of thy son be poured out as a precious Ointment, that the virgins again may love thee? Lord,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:200424:167"/> let us be thy patients though thou woundest us: under thy rod, rather then we should be out of thy covenant; rather then we should sleep to death, sound thy trumpet, beat thine alarm; rather then we should not have thy <hi>presence,</hi> let us go into a furnace; thy <hi>Son,</hi> let us have a storm; rather then we should not be thy <hi>Children,</hi> whip us; thy <hi>servants,</hi> beat us; thy <hi>spouse,</hi> chide us; thy <hi>friends,</hi> frown on us. O sound a retreat to our disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; let all thy Saints engage their prayers and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours against the common enemy; that <hi>Sion</hi> may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible as an army with banners; that the brats of Babylon may come and worship before her feet, and know that thou hast loved her. If the building of Sion may not go forward in this age, Lord, let it not go backward; if we may not build thy spiritual temple, let us at least lay up stuff for the building it in the next generation. O, how sad is it, that those who have been brought up in scarlet, should embrace dunghills? And that <hi>England</hi> that was the <hi>Terrour</hi> of the Lord, to the nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, should so much be a <hi>scorn</hi> unto them, and a <hi>terrour</hi> one to another? O make up our breaches, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our differences, heal our disorders, unite our hearts to thee and one another: Restore, continue our forfeited mercies, prevent and remove our deserved judgments, be no more a <hi>consuming fire</hi> among us, but a <hi>wall of fire</hi> round about us to secure us and destroy our enemies; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to bless us, and to watch over us, and to do us good: let us begin the reparation of our ruines, in the reformation of all our lives. Sanctifie the various dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of thy providence towards us. Turn us unto thee by a speedy and an unfeigned repentance. O let the power of thy arm who art the Lord of Host, and the power of thy spirit, who art the God of all grace, now
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:200424:168"/> appear and be exercised for and upon us: let thy power deliver us from the dangers wherewith we are surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and thy grace so sanctifie this deliverance, that it may work those blessed effects among us, which no former dispensations have done, even to <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> us. Let thy mercies overcome the desert and cry of our hainous sins, and be now manifested towards us for thine own name sake; and let the manifestation of these undeserved mercies, overcome our stubborn hearts; that we may be ashamed, and loath our selves when we remember our own evil wayes; that ever we should be so basely disingenuous to rebel against a God of such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and compassion, who notwithstanding all our unworthiness and provocations of his glorious majesty, yet in our low estate, hath pityed, and seasonably reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us. Wherefore, <hi>give glory to thy own name,</hi> O God, we beseech thee, <hi>give glory to thy own name,</hi> in redeeming Israel, England, out of all its troubles, and from its iniquities; that hereby we may be not only engaged, but enabled to serve and glorifie thee, as thy redeemed ones for ever.</p>
